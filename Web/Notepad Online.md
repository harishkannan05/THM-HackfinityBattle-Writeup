# Solution
Go to the site and login with the given credentials.
We see this screen with the URL: http://10.10.10.15/note.php?note_id=1

Clue here is that “the note will only be visible to you”. So we try to view others’ notes by changing the note id.  
Changing the URL to: http://10.10.252.73/note.php?note_id=0
