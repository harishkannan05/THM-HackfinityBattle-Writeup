# Solution
Heading over to the site, we can view the contract's source code.

The contractâ€™s logic is straightforward, it only unlocks if you provide the correct number via the `unlock function`.  
The flag is stored in the `secret variable` and is only revealed by the `getFlag function` once `unlock_flag` is set to true.  
The `unlock function` takes an input and compares it to the stored variable `code`. If they match, it sets unlock_flag to true.  
We can try to read `code` from the contract's storage.

Now, we can send a transaction to call `unlock`

Now, we can call the `getFlag()` function to reveal the flag.
